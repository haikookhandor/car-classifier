## Technical Know-How

## 1. Text Extraction
- **PDF Text Extraction:** Utilized the PyPDF2 library to programmatically extract raw text from PDF documents. Extracted text content from each page of the PDF, preserving the document's structure and formatting.


## 2. Model Selection
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier:** Chose the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm due to its efficiency in handling NLP tasks. Car Brochure PDF's contain a lot of words where many are redundant or irrelevant. Occurrence of one feature does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other feature. For small sample sizes, Na√Øve Bayes can outperform the most powerful alternatives. Being relatively robust, easy to implement, fast, and accurate, this was the reason for the model selection.

## 4. Text Vectorization
- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Utilized TfidfVectorizer to convert raw text into a numerical format, considering term frequency and inverse document frequency to highlight the importance of specific terms in distinguishing documents.

## 5. Model Deployment
- **Joblib Model Saving:** Saved the trained model using the joblib library, serializing the model to disk for later deployment. 

## 6. Streamlit App
- **Streamlit:** Developed a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, integrating it seamlessly with the backend model for user interaction.
